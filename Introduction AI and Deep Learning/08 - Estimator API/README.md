## Estimators

- Are mathematical models made available by TensorFlow;
- They are high-level APIs that allow us to leave the complexity of gradient descent to the estimator;
- Mostly useful in large neural networks;


__Basic Explanation__:

- Instantiate an estimator object;
- Specify a list of all possible features: possibly a very large feature vector;
- Create an input function;
- Which will also specify the batch size and the number of epochs;
