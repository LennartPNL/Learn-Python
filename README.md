# Learn Python


In this repository i will show you some examples of Python code, with some comments to explain what i am doing.
Some programming knowledge is useful, but not required.
Just read the code, run the code, edit the code and see what it does.

#### More...
  

Python is a versatile programming language with a clean syntax. 
Learning Python is pretty cool, unless you have to read all the documentation.
That's why i did the boring part of reading all kinds of documentation and books.
I decided to take a shot at Python because it seems to be used in real life 
much more than the languages i'm being taught in college at the moment.
Feel free to use, copy and share this code however and wherever you want.

I am not a sad little wanker that accuses you of plagiarism over one line of code. 
All of the code in this repository can be used anywhere without my permission.
