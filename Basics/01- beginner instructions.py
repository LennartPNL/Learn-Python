# So you've decided to learn some Python?
# Great! But you are probably wondering how to start.

# Go to https://www.python.org/ and download a version of Python 3 for your OS
# Install Pyhon for all users

# Now, find the program IDLE
# Start the IDLE version for your OS (32/64 Bit)

# The window that opens, is the Python shell, where code can be executed

# For editing and saving code, select the 'File' dropdown
# And select new file
# You can run files by pressing F5 (Try this one first!)

# Good Luck!
 

# P.S: you can always donate....
