### Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions are used to math parts of text.
You can match text by going over it character by character, but that will result in miles of code.
For example, American phone numbers are constructed like 000-000-0000.
You can use a Regular Expression to easily find any number constructed in this way.
Regular Expression can be compared to your CTRL+F function.

I have also made an example program that finds all email adresses and (American) phone numbers that are on your clipboard.
