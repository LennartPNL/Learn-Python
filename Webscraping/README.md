Webscraping might be one of the coolest features in Python.
Not only can you open your browser and automate certain tasks, 
you can also extract all kinds of data from the web.
In this folder, I will show you how to do them both.
I've also written a program that extracts data from imdb and writes it to your own database! 

You will need to install the following pips:

pip install bs4
pip install requests
pip install lxml
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install random
